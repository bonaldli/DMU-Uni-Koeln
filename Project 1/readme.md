# Welcome to Project 1: Bayesian Structure Learning 
After finishing this project, you will be able to get thorough understanding about Bayesian Network and Structure Learning.

## Datasets
First of all, we have three datasets, and the summaries are given as below:
| Dataset  | Number of Variables | Source | Further Reading | Content |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Titanic Data | 8 | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) | (1) [probability](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1166/problem12.html) | (1) original data; (2) simplified data (recommended)|
| Wine Prediction Data | 12 | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dropout/winequalityred) |  (1) [descriptive analysis](https://rpubs.com/Hpolhe/950288) (in R); (2) [sales prediction case](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/840867_cdbf78a38ded4b10be5af93271ee7593.html#DATA_EXPLORATION)| (1) original data; (2) simplified data (recommended) |
| California House Price (Bonus) | 10 | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices) | N/A | try original data |

## Task
You will use python to learn the structure for the datasets of _Titanic_ and _Wine_, associated with the Bayesian Score.
